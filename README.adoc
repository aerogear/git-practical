= Git Practial

Introducing the fundamentals of git using the command line

== Objectives

=== Why use a version control system (such as Git)?

* You can keep track of the changes you make to your project as you
work on it (like 'save points' in a computer game, you can go back
to previous states)
* If you're working on the same project as other people, it helps you
handle the synchronization (friction?) points when you make changes

=== Why use Git specifically?

* It's the most popular (the default?), and it strikes a good balance
between being easy to use, and being powerful
* It's decentralized, so you can do everything offline, and don't need
to configure any server
* It makes it easy to try new things locally without having to worry
about breaking everything, or losing stuff
