= Hooks

Do something before or after a particular action

* Server-side hooks: we can't use them because of Github. Use webhooks instead
* Client-side hooks:
 ** 'git am' hooks: we don't use 'am', so we don't care
 ** Commit:
  *** post-commit
  *** commit-msg
  *** prepare-commit-msg
  *** pre-commit
 ** Others
  *** pre-rebase
  *** post-checkout
  *** post-merge
  *** pre-push
  *** pre-auto-gc
  *** post-rewrite
